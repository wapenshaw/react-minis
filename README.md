# React Projects I made during learning React with Typescript.

Demo: [React minis](https://wapenshaw.github.io/react-minis)

This branch ends with me practicing react with class based components.

The master branch will have all the components reworked with hooks and updated to use Material UI or Some other UI Framework.
